Concise CSS is a lightweight CSS framework that provides a number of great features without the bloat.

Concise CSS provides a solid foundation to stylize your website. It offers an alternative to frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, with the difference that Concise only includes the minimum styles required. That does not mean that the features are limited; is possible to use add-ons on top of the core to extend the functionality as required.

The core of the framework only includes styles for native HTML elements. Components and utilities are provided as optional add-ons, Concise UI and Concise Utils, respectively.

Concise CSS is written using a custom CSS preprocessor, built on top of Sass and some PostCSS plugins; this means that you can still write Sass code as usual, but you can also enjoy of other custom features, like the `lh` unit provided to handle vertical rhythm.
